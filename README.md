## Notes

- Large files may cause freezing when saving, so it is recommended to save your work frequently and avoid working with excessively large files.
- Deleting an Excalidraw drawing within Logseq will also delete the original file.

## Why I made Excalidraw plugin
The reason for developing this plugin is that the excalidraw build-in with logseq cannot meet my needs, such as preview and full-screen operation.

I hope this plugin can help users easily showcase their ideas, so it needs to have the following features:

- full-screen operation
- support excalidraw library
- customize drawing name (in development)
- drawing management dashboard (in development)

Another point is that the plugin will remain synchronized with the official version of Excalidraw.

## Roadmap

- [x] image preview
- [x] full-screen operation
- [x] support excalidraw library
- [x] customize font family
- [x] customize drawing name
- [x] drawing management dashboard
